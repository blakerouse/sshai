hosts that you can SSH into and perform commands.

## How to Setup

Checkout the repository:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/blakerouse/sshai
```

Build the binary:

```shell
$ go build .
```

Update the MCP configuration for Claude Desktop:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ssh": {
      "command": "<PATH_TO_BUILT_SSHAI_BINARY>",
      "args": ["--storage", "<PATH_TO_STORE_HOSTS>", "--openai", "<OPENAI_API_KEY>"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop

## How to Use

First add a host that you want to be able to interact with:

`add host with name <name> connecting with ssh://<USER>:<PASS>@<IP>`

You can then list the hosts available with:

`list my hosts`

You can add another host with same command again (multiple hosts will perform the same
command on the provided hosts):

`add host with name <name> connecting with ssh://<USER>:<PASS>@<IP>`

Ask for the OS information for all added hosts:

`show OS information for all hosts`

Ask for it to check if any of the hosts need to be updated:

`do any of my hosts need to be updated`

Ask it to upgrade a specific host (or all, it will do it at the same time):

`upgrade host <name>`
